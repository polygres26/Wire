"""End-to-end proof that a real SQL Server client (pymssql, real TDS wire protocol) gets correct
results through mssqlwire's T-SQL dialect translation into a real Postgres backend -- real
subprocess, real Postgres container, no mocks.

KNOWN GAPS documented (not silently worked around) by these tests:
  - Every value comes back as a string over TDS regardless of its real Postgres type --
    MssqlWireSessionHandler/TdsTokens.writeColMetaData has no per-column type mapping yet (unlike
    orawire's VARCHAR2/NUMBER/DATE mapping), so numeric/int comparisons below compare as strings.
  - mssqlwire has no session-scoped connection: MssqlWireSessionHandler opens a fresh Postgres
    connection per statement (`try (Connection backend = PgConnections.open(options))`) and closes
    it immediately after, unlike orawire's session-scoped LazyPooledConnection. BEGIN/COMMIT/
    ROLLBACK TRAN are translated to valid SQL (see DialectTranslations.normalizeSqlServer) so they
    no longer error, but there is no real cross-statement transaction state to roll back yet.
